# Modelling-of-IC-Engine

Using MATLAB, develop a comprehensive simulation of an internal combustion engine, implementing advanced thermodynamic modeling and analysis techniques.

Weekly Topics: 

Week 1: Simulation of Ideal Gas Processes
Objective: Gain a foundational understanding of thermodynamic processes through computational methods.
Assignment: Using MATLAB, simulate and analyze the behavior of an ideal gas in a closed system undergoing:
Isothermal Compression
Adiabatic Expansion

Week 2: Otto Cycle Simulation
Understanding of Otto cycle and its simulation 
Assignment: Simulate the Otto cycle, an idealized cycle representing spark-ignition engines, covering the four primary processes:
Compression
Combustion
Expansion
Exhaust

Deliverables: Plot Pressure-Volume (P-V) and Temperature-Entropy (T-S) diagrams for visual analysis of each stage in the cycle.
Week 3: Review and Doubt Clearance
Activities:
Detailed review of assignments from Week 1 and Week 2.
Solutions discussions and doubt clearance sessions.

Week 4: Final Project - Detailed IC Engine Simulation
Project Task: Using MATLAB, develop a comprehensive simulation of an internal combustion engine, implementing advanced thermodynamic modeling and analysis techniques.
